# Narrahunt Phase 2 Debugging Summary

## Overview
All five main scripts in the Narrahunt Phase 2 codebase have been tested and fixed. The system is now functioning correctly, albeit with expected warnings about missing API keys when running in a test environment.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Extractor Functions
The most critical issue was in `src/modules/extractors.py`, which was missing three key functions:
- `extract_json_keystores()`
- `extract_seed_phrases()`
- `extract_api_keys()`

These functions were referenced in `extract_artifacts_from_html()` but not implemented, causing errors during extraction. I implemented these functions following the same pattern and style as the existing extractor functions.

### 2. Missing Import in Enhanced Artifact Detector
In `src/modules/enhanced_artifact_detector.py`, the `re` module was being used without being imported. I added the import within the method where it's used.

## Testing Results
All five target scripts now run successfully:
- src/detective_agent.py ✅ 
- src/integrated_main.py ✅ 
- src/main.py ✅ 
- src/run_real_objective.py ✅ 
- src/run_autonomous.py ✅ 

## Module Path Fixes
No invalid import patterns were found in the codebase. All imports are already properly structured.

## Expected Warnings
The system shows warnings about:
1. Missing API keys (CLAUDE_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY)
2. Missing source_profiles.json file

These are expected in a test environment and the code properly falls back to default behaviors.

## Additional Notes
- Backups of modified files were created in `/home/computeruse/backup/debug_fixes/`
- Detailed test results are available in `test_results.txt`
- Full output logs are available in `last_run_output.log`

All modifications were minimal and focused on fixing the specific issues without changing the architecture or behavior of the system.
