# API Error Handling Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the error handling improvements made to the Narrahunt Phase 2 project for LLM and Wayback Machine API integrations.

## Changes Made

### llm_integration.py

1. Added comprehensive error handling for `_call_claude()` method:
   - Added try/except block around `response.json()` call
   - Added validation for the expected fields in the response structure
   - Added specific handling for JSONDecodeError, KeyError, and IndexError exceptions
   - Added appropriate error logging
   - Ensured graceful fallback to returning empty JSON when errors occur

2. Added comprehensive error handling for `_call_openai()` method:
   - Added try/except block around `response.json()` call
   - Added validation for the expected fields in the response structure
   - Added specific handling for JSONDecodeError, KeyError, and IndexError exceptions
   - Added appropriate error logging
   - Ensured graceful fallback to returning empty JSON when errors occur

### wayback_integration.py

1. Added error handling for JSON parsing in the `check_availability()` method:
   - Added try/except block around `response.json()` call
   - Added specific handling for JSONDecodeError exceptions
   - Added appropriate error logging
   - Ensured graceful fallback to returning empty results when errors occur

## Testing

The implemented error handling was tested with:

1. `verify_api_keys.py` - Verified successful API calls with valid keys
2. `test_error_handling.py` - Created custom tests for error handling scenarios
3. Manual testing with invalid input scenarios

All tests confirmed that the system now gracefully handles API errors without crashing.

## Benefits

1. **Improved Stability**: The system can now handle malformed API responses without crashing
2. **Better Logging**: Detailed error logs make debugging API issues easier
3. **Graceful Degradation**: System continues to function even when API calls fail
4. **Better User Experience**: Failures are handled internally rather than exposing errors to users
