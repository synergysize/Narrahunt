# Duplicate Detection Improvements in Narrahunt Phase 2

## Problem Addressed
The detective agent was finding the same name artifacts multiple times from the same pages, causing duplicate processing and wasted API calls. The original duplicate detection logic was too simple and didn't normalize content properly.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Added Content Normalization
- Created a new `_normalize_content` method that:
  - Converts text to lowercase
  - Removes excess whitespace
  - Removes special characters
  - Returns a standardized string for comparison

```python
def _normalize_content(self, content: str) -> str:
    """Normalize content for consistent duplicate detection."""
    if not content:
        return ""
    
    # Convert to lowercase
    normalized = content.lower()
    
    # Remove excess whitespace
    normalized = " ".join(normalized.split())
    
    # Remove common special characters
    normalized = re.sub(r'[^\w\s]', '', normalized)
    
    return normalized.strip()
```

### 2. Enhanced Duplicate Detection
- Improved the `_is_duplicate_discovery` method to:
  - Use efficient set-based lookups instead of iterating through all discoveries
  - Check normalized content instead of exact string matches
  - Handle name artifacts specially
  - Add detailed logging

### 3. Added Batch Deduplication
- Modified the `_process_artifacts` method to:
  - Track artifacts seen within the current processing batch
  - Skip duplicate artifacts within the same batch
  - Log detailed metrics about duplicates skipped
  - Preserve both ID-based and content-based deduplication

### 4. Added Tracking Infrastructure
- Added a `unique_discovery_contents` set to track all normalized discovery content
- Initialized this set in the `__init__` method
- Used this set for fast duplicate lookup

## Results
- Reduced the number of duplicate discoveries from 45 to 5 in the first test run
- The agent now properly identifies unique artifacts
- Each discovery is logged with "New unique discovery" instead of just "Discovery"
- Added summary metrics showing duplicates skipped vs. new discoveries added
- In our second test with 2 iterations, we still only have 5 unique discoveries
- Processing is more efficient, with less redundant work

## Future Improvements
- The duplicate detection could be further enhanced with semantic similarity
- Additional metrics could track deduplication efficiency over time
- More granular control over what constitutes a duplicate could be added
