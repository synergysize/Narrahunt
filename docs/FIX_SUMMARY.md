# System Fixes Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the fixes made to the Narrative Discovery Matrix system to resolve integration issues and improve functionality.

## 1. Real Entities in Matrix

- Updated the `narrative_matrix.json` configuration file with real entities:
  - Added Vitalik Buterin, Matt Furie, Gavin Wood, Ethereum Foundation, Satoshi Nakamoto, Joseph Lubin, and Charles Hoskinson
  - Removed placeholder entities like "John Doe" and "CryptoProject X"
  - Ensured all required artifact types were present (name, personal, code, wallet, legal)

## 2. LLM Integration

- Created a new `llm_integration.py` module that provides:
  - Integration with Claude API using the provided key
  - Integration with OpenAI API using the provided key
  - Text analysis capabilities for narrative evaluation
  - Research strategy generation support

- Updated the `llm_research_strategy.py` module to:
  - Use the real LLM integration instead of simulated responses
  - Properly format and normalize URLs to ensure they are crawlable
  - Fix issues with Wayback Machine URL patterns

## 3. Artifact Extraction Debugging

- Enhanced the `artifact_extractor.py` module with:
  - Added detailed debug logging to see what content is being processed
  - Improved error handling and reporting
  - Added content preview logging to help diagnose extraction issues
  - Added per-artifact type logging to identify which extractors are failing

## 4. Crawler Integration

- Created a new `crawler.py` module that:
  - Provides a unified interface for crawling
  - Integrates with the URL queue, fetch, and extract components
  - Includes search functionality for keyword-based research
  - Properly respects robots.txt and crawl delays

## 5. Test and Verification Scripts

- Created multiple test scripts to verify the fixes:
  - `test_fixes.py`: General test of all system components
  - `test_vitalik_names.py`: Specific test for name artifacts around Vitalik
  - `run_real_objective.py`: Full test of the integrated system with a real objective

## Results

The system now successfully:
1. Uses real API keys for LLM integration
2. Works with real entities instead of placeholders
3. Provides improved debugging for artifact extraction
4. Integrates properly with the crawler infrastructure
5. Can run real objectives like "Find name artifacts around Vitalik Buterin"

## Remaining Challenges

Some challenges still exist:
1. DuckDuckGo blocks crawler access through robots.txt
2. Some domains may have extraction difficulties due to JavaScript rendering
3. The name artifact extraction could be further improved for specific entity types

## Next Steps

1. Further enhance the specialized extractors for different artifact types
2. Improve the integration with JavaScript-heavy websites
3. Add more targeted search strategies for specific artifact types
4. Add more real entities to the matrix configuration
