# Google Gemini Integration

## Summary
This enhancement adds Google Gemini as a third LLM option in the detective agent's LLM integration module, complementing the existing Claude and OpenAI models. Gemini can be used as a primary LLM or as a fallback when other models fail.

## Changes Made

1. **Added Google API Key Support**:
   - Added `GOOGLE_API_KEY` constant in `llm_integration.py`
   - Added the API key to the `.env` file
   - Set the API key value to the provided key: `AIzaSyAa__kXU5Nr63Kzgzfl8hXpRG2rAX8JGHM`

2. **Updated LLMIntegration Class Initialization**:
   - Added `use_gemini` parameter to the constructor
   - Added validation for the Google API key
   - Updated logging to include Gemini status

3. **Implemented Gemini API Call Method**:
   - Added `_call_gemini(prompt)` method that calls the Gemini API
   - Used the appropriate Gemini API endpoint and request format
   - Added proper error handling and logging

4. **Enhanced Failover Mechanism**:
   - Modified the `analyze` method to try Gemini as a fallback option
   - Updated Claude's failover to try Gemini if OpenAI is not available
   - Created a cascading fallback system: Claude → OpenAI → Gemini

5. **Created Testing Tools**:
   - Added `test_gemini.py` script to verify Gemini integration
   - Included both direct Gemini call testing and failover testing

## How to Use Gemini

### As Primary LLM
```python
from llm_integration import LLMIntegration

# Use Gemini as the primary LLM
llm = LLMIntegration(use_claude=False, use_openai=False, use_gemini=True)

# Call the LLM
result = llm.analyze("Your text to analyze", context="Optional context")
```

### As Backup LLM
The integration now supports automatic failover to Gemini when Claude or OpenAI fails:

```python
# Configure Claude as primary with Gemini as backup
llm = LLMIntegration(use_claude=True, use_openai=False, use_gemini=True)

# If Claude fails, it will automatically try Gemini
```

### Testing the Integration
Run the test script to verify that Gemini integration works properly:

```bash
python test_gemini.py
```

## Failover Logic

The new failover sequence is:

1. If Claude is primary and fails:
   - Try OpenAI if available
   - If OpenAI is not available, try Gemini if available

2. If OpenAI is primary and fails:
   - Try Gemini if available

3. If all LLMs fail:
   - Return a generic response

This ensures the detective agent has multiple fallback options to maintain continuity of operation even when primary LLM services experience issues.
