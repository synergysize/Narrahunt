# Narrative Discovery Matrix - Automatic Discovery Reporting

## Overview

This update adds automatic discovery reporting to the Narrative Discovery Matrix system. After each research cycle, the system now generates and outputs concise summaries of discoveries, providing continuous visibility into what the system is finding.

## Files Modified

- **integrated_main.py**: Added the `generate_discovery_summary` method and updated stats tracking
- **URL tracking**: Enhanced to track source domains and Wayback Machine snapshots

## New Components

- **Session Summaries**: Created in `results/session_summaries/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM.txt`
- **Discovery Log**: Running history in `results/discovery_log.txt`
- **Demo Script**: `demo_auto_reporting.py` for demonstrating the feature

## Features

Each discovery summary includes:

1. **Research Stats**: URLs processed, artifacts found, and high-scoring discoveries
2. **Top Sources**: Most productive domains with page counts
3. **Discovery Highlights**: Name, score, type, and source for top findings
4. **Next Objectives**: Upcoming objectives in the research queue

## Example Usage

To run the system with automatic discovery reporting:

```bash
# Run with a specific objective
python integrated_main.py --objective "Find name artifacts around Vitalik Buterin"

# Run in autonomous mode
python integrated_main.py --auto

# Run the demonstration
python demo_auto_reporting.py
```

## Documentation

Detailed documentation is available in `docs/automatic_discovery_reporting.md`.

## Testing

Several test scripts have been created to verify the functionality:

- **test_discovery_reporting.py**: Full system test
- **test_summary_only.py**: Test summary generation in isolation
- **demo_auto_reporting.py**: Demo with simulated discoveries

## Benefits

This enhancement provides:

1. **Real-time Visibility**: Immediate feedback on discoveries
2. **Progress Tracking**: Clear metrics on research progress
3. **Source Analysis**: Identification of productive research sources
4. **Historical Record**: Persistent log of all research sessions
5. **Focus on Narratives**: Highlights narrative-worthy discoveries

The automatic discovery reporting makes the system more transparent and easier to monitor, while maintaining a complete history of all research activities.
