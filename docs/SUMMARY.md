# Narrative Discovery Matrix System - Implementation Summary

The Narrative Discovery Matrix System has been successfully implemented and integrated with the existing crawler infrastructure. Here's a summary of what has been built:

## Core Components

1. **Narrative Matrix (`narrative_matrix.py`)**
   - Defines artifact types: code, wallet, name, personal, legal, academic, hidden, institutional
   - Defines target entities: crypto devs, meme creators, companies, institutions
   - Generates objectives by combining artifact types with entities
   - Tracks objective progress and manages discoveries
   - Records narrative-worthy findings
   - Auto-expands with new artifact types and entities discovered during research

2. **Objectives Manager (`objectives_manager.py`)**
   - Loads or generates objectives from the matrix
   - Manages the execution of objectives
   - Detects when objectives hit dead ends
   - Auto-generates follow-up objectives based on discoveries
   - Integrates with existing crawler and LLM components when available

3. **Integration System (`main_integration.py`)**
   - Connects the matrix with the existing crawler
   - Uses objective-driven targeting for the crawler
   - Feeds crawler discoveries back to the matrix
   - Focuses on high-value targets identified by the matrix

## Configuration and Data Files

- **Matrix Configuration**: `/config/narrative_matrix.json`
- **Current Objective**: `/results/current_objective.txt`
- **Narrative Findings**: `/results/narratives/*.json`

## Autonomous Operation

The system can run autonomously through:

1. **Basic Autonomous Mode**: `run_autonomous.py`
   - Continuously generates and pursues objectives
   - Configurable cycle count and delay between cycles
   - Detailed logging of all operations

2. **Integrated Autonomous Mode**: `main_integration.py`
   - Uses the matrix to guide the existing crawler
   - Matrix-generated objectives determine crawler targets
   - Discoveries from crawler feed back to expand the matrix

## Testing

- **Test Script**: `test_system.py`
   - Verifies all matrix components work correctly
   - Tests objective generation and discovery recording
   - Demonstrates follow-up objective generation

## Integration with Existing System

The matrix has been integrated with the existing crawler system:
- It leverages the artifact extraction logic already present
- Discovered artifacts are evaluated for narrative worthiness
- New entities found in artifacts are added back to the matrix
- The system uses the existing URL queue and fetching mechanisms

## Current Status

The system is operational and generating objectives autonomously. It has successfully:
- Generated initial objectives combining artifact types and entities
- Recorded test discoveries and expanded the matrix configuration
- Demonstrated the ability to move between objectives
- Shown integration with the existing artifact extraction system

## Next Steps

1. Further enhance the integration with the existing crawler
2. Add more specialized artifact types based on discoveries
3. Implement more sophisticated objective prioritization
4. Add visualization of the matrix and discoveries
