# LLM Failover Chain Implementation

## Overview

This enhancement implements a complete LLM failover chain in the detective agent to ensure continuous operation even when one or more LLM services experience issues. The failover chain follows this sequence:

1. Claude (Primary)
2. OpenAI (Secondary/Backup)
3. Gemini (Tertiary/Final Backup)

## Problem Addressed

Previously, the detective agent only tried Claude and then OpenAI before giving up. This meant that if both services were unavailable or exceeded their quota limits, the investigation would stall completely, even though Gemini was available as a third option.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced Failover Logic

The following methods were updated with complete failover logic:

- `_get_initial_research_strategy`
- `_consult_llm_for_next_steps`
- `_generate_new_leads`
- `_generate_investigation_summary`

Each method now follows this pattern:

```python
# Try Claude first
llm = self._get_llm_instance()
result = None

if llm.use_claude:
    result = llm._call_claude(prompt)
    
# If Claude failed, try OpenAI
if not result or result.strip() == "{}":
    logger.warning("Claude failed, trying OpenAI as backup")
    try:
        backup_llm = LLMIntegration(use_claude=False, use_openai=True)
        result = backup_llm._call_openai(prompt)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.warning(f"OpenAI also failed: {str(e)}")
        result = None
        
# If both Claude and OpenAI failed, try Gemini
if not result or result.strip() == "{}":
    logger.warning("Claude and OpenAI failed, trying Gemini as final backup")
    try:
        gemini_llm = LLMIntegration(use_claude=False, use_openai=False, use_gemini=True)
        result = gemini_llm._call_gemini(prompt)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"All LLM services failed. Gemini error: {str(e)}")
        result = "{}"  # Default empty result if all services fail
```

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling

- Added explicit try/except blocks around each service call
- Added more detailed error logging to track which service failed and why
- Implemented graceful degradation when all services fail

### 3. LLM Integration Support

The implementation leverages the existing `LLMIntegration` class which already had support for Gemini with:
- The `use_gemini` parameter in `__init__`
- The `_call_gemini` method for making API calls to Google's Gemini model

## Benefits

1. **Resilience**: The investigation can continue even if two LLM services fail
2. **Continuity**: No manual intervention needed when one service exceeds its quota
3. **Robustness**: Better error handling and logging throughout the LLM interaction flow
4. **Efficiency**: Minimizes downtime in automated investigation workflows

## Usage Notes

The agent will automatically attempt to use each service in sequence until it gets a valid response. The fallback is completely transparent to the rest of the agent's logic.

If all three services fail, the agent will log an error and continue with a default/empty response, allowing the investigation to proceed with other targets rather than crashing completely.
